          <h2>Libre</h2>
          <p>Taler is free software implementing an open protocol. Anybody is welcome to inspect our code and integrate our reference implementation into their applications.
             Different components of Taler are being made available under different licenses. The Affero GPLv3+ is used for the Mint, the LGPLv3+ is used for reference
             code demonstrating integration with merchant platforms, and licenses like Apache/Mozilla/GPLv3+ are used for wallets and related customer-facing software.
             We are open for constructive suggestions for maximizing the adoption of this libre payment platform.</p>

          <h2>RESTful</h2>
          <p>Taler is designed to work on the Internet.  To ensure that Taler payments can work with restrictive network setups, Taler uses a RESTful protocol over
             HTTP or HTTPS. Taler's security does not depend upon the use of HTTPS, but obviously merchants may choose to offer HTTPS for consistency and because
             it generally is better for privacy compared to HTTP.  Taler uses JSON to encode structure data, making it easy to integrate Taler with existing Web
             applications.  Taler's protocol is documented in detail <a href="http://api.taler.net/">here</a>.</p>
