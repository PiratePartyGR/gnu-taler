          <h2>Taxable</h2>
          <p>Taler is an electronic payment system that was built with the goal of supporting taxation.
             With Taler, the receiver of any form of payment is known, and the payment information comes
             attached with details about what the payment was made for.  Thus, governments can use this
             data to tax buisnesses and individuals based on their income, making tax evasion and
             black markets less viable.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h2>Secure</h2>
          <p>Taler's payments are cryptographically secured. Thus, customers, merchants and
             the mint can mathemtically demonstrate their lawful behavior in court in case
             of disputes. Financial damages are strictly limited, improving economic security
             for individuals, merchants, the mint and the state.  Most importantly, an
             independent auditor can ensure that there is no &quot;bad mint&quot;
             within the Taler system who might threaten the economy due to fraud.</p>

          <h2>Libre</h2>
          <p>Taler is free software implementing an open protocol standard.  Thus, Taler will
             enable competition and avoid the monopolization of payment systems that threatens
             global political and financial stability today.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h2>Efficient</h2>
          <p>Taler is designed to be efficient.  Unlike timeline-based payment systems like
             BitCoin, Taler will not threaten the availability of national electric grids or
             (significantly) contribute to environmental pollution.</p>
