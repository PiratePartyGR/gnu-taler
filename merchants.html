          <p lang="en">Processing transactions with Taler is fast, allowing you to confirm the transaction with
             your customer virtually immediately.  Your customers will appreciate that they do not have
             to type in credit card information and play the "verified by" game.  By making payments
             significantly more convenient for your customers, you may be able to use Taler
             for small transactions that would not work with credit card payments due to the mental
             overhead for customers.</p>

          <p lang="en">You never learn sensitive customer information. You need to ensure that your website
             provides the correct account information for your business, and that you correctly
             validate the payment confirmations from the Taler mint.  As a result, you will have
             cryptographic proof of payment for the specific contracts you entered with your
             customers, and cryptographically signed confirmations from the Taler mint about the
             deposits. Taler does not require you to undergo any particular security audits,
             processes or procedures, as you never handle sensitive customer information.
             Your systems will have cryptographically signed contracts which you can use in
             court in case of disputes.</p>

             need to pay license fees, and the free software development model will ensure that
             you can select from many competent developers to help you with your integration.</p>

          <p lang="en">Taler is designed to minimize the work the Mint needs to perform.  Combined with
             Taler's strong security which prevents fraud, mints can operate with very
             low overhead and thus low transaction fees.  Given Taler's free software mint
             reference implementation, competition among mints will ensure fair, low
             transaction fees for merchants.</p>

          <p lang="en">Taler does not support tax evasion or money laundering, and is
             also not a pyramid scheme or speculative investment.  Taler's
             protocols are efficient and do not waste energy. Taler encourages
             competition by providing an open standard and free software
             reference implementations.</p>
