          <h2>Efficient</h2>
          <p>Taler uses efficient cryptographic primitives (such as RSA 2048 and
             EdDSA) and is thus expected to be able to handle large transaction
             volumes, only limited by the input/output capabilities of the
             database. Thus, running a Taler mint should be profitable even
             with very low (less than 1 cent) transaction fees (at appropriate
             transaction volume).</p>

          <h2>Secure</h2>
          <p>All transactions in Taler are secured using modern cryptography and
             trust in all parties is minimized. Financial damage is bounded
             (for customers, merchants and the mint) even
             in the case that systems are compromised and private keys are stolen.
             Databases can be audited for consistency, resulting in either the
             detection of compromised systems or the demonstration that
             participants were honest.</p>

          <h2>Business Model</h2>
          <p>The basic business model for Taler is the operation of a mint.  A
             mint converts money from traditional payment systems (Mastercard,
             SEPA, Visa, BitCoin, ACH, SWIFT, etc.) to anonymous electronic
             coins in the same currency. The customer can then redeem the electronic
             coins at a merchant, who can exchange them for money represented using
             traditional payment systems at the mint.  The mint can then charge
             fees (to the customer, merchant or both) to facilitate the transactions.</p>
