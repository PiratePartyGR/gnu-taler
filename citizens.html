          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>Taler is the electronic equivalent of cash, except harder to fake.
             If your digital wallet is lost -- say because
             your computer is irreparably damaged or compromised -- only the amount of coin
             stored in your wallet will be lost. Unlike a physical wallet, you can make
             backups of your digital wallet which can provide security against data loss.
             So your digital wallet works mostly just like
             a physical wallet, except online and without the need to manually count coins.</p>

          <h2>Privacy</h2>
          <p>Your transactions are private, neither the mint (bank) nor merchant needs to
             learn your identity. There is no need to give our credit card numbers or
             other sensitive information, and the merchant will only be able to do
             exactly the transaction you confirmed using your digital wallet.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-2">
          <h2>Convenience</h2>
          <p>You will be able to withdraw digital coins to replenish your wallet using
             your credit card or SEPA transactions, similar to how you pay or withdraw
             cash today.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-2">
          <h2>Stability </h2>
          <p>Coins in your digital wallet will be of the same denomination as the
             cash in your physical wallet. So you will not have to worry about
             currency fluctuations or conversion rates. Like a physical wallet,
             you can carry digital coins of different currencies in your digital
             wallet at the same time.</p>
